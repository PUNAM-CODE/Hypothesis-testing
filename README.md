Four Steps of Hypothesis Testing
All hypotheses are tested using a four-step process:

1 The first step is for the analyst to state the two hypotheses so that only one can be right.
2 The next step is to formulate an analysis plan, which outlines how the data will be evaluated.
3 The third step is to carry out the plan and physically analyze the sample data.
4 The fourth and final step is to analyze the results and either reject the null hypothesis, or state that the null hypothesis is plausible, given the data.
